# fsac-demo

![](11o.png)

is a demo for fsac, a game.

the game will, hopefully, be good.

## is what?

a game that crudely simulates evolution.

believe us, we were IB biology students.

## "we"? who makes this?

cb / greekfellows and jimmy.

both are very lazy people.

## any docs for genes and alleles?

see `documentation.md`.

note that we aren't following real-life nomenclature for genes and alleles at this point. currently, alleles have names like those of real-life genes.

## building

the developer needs help coming up with platform-specific build and linker instructions.
